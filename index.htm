<td class="vm">
<center>
<pre>To protect and promote the right of every 
Filipino to quality, equitable, culture-based,
and complete basic education where:
Students learn in a child-friendly, gender-sensitive,
safe, and motivating environment.
Teachers facilitate learning and constantly nurture 
every learner. Administrators and staff, as stewards 
of the institution, ensure an enabling and supportive 
environment for effective learning to happen.
Family, community, and other stakeholders are actively 
engaged and share responsibility for developing life-long 
learners.</pre>
